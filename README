This is Elliott Kemberâ€™s JavaScript Snake project. It simulates the game Snake, and supports multiple snakes, CPU-controlled snakes, and other options.

In the game Snake, the player, a snake, must eat (run into) food that appears in a random place on the game grid. The snake must not eat itself, but this goal is made harder to achieve by the fact that every time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows one square longer.
